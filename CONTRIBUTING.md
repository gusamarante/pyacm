# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish 
to make via issue or pull request. Make sure that any contributions use 
consistent code conventions and clear function/method/variable names. The code 
must be clearly commented, documenting intentions and edge cases. There must be 
no sensitive materials in the revision history, issues, or pull requests (for 
example, passwords or other non-public information).

Please be polite and cordial in your interactions.
